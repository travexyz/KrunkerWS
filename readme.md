# KrunkerWS Script
## *Managing lat your advantage*
---
####  Originale script NasaPeak made by Lemons(?) I just adjusted it a bit
####  KrunkerWS lets you activate FakeLag and adjust its power to make you just teleport-lag around the map whenever you want.
## How does it work?
> #### By delaying the packets you send to the server. 
## Does it really help you?
> #### Not much and not always. <br> For example: it may give you advantage of few seconds when peeking corners while b-hopping but in a close fight it's a disadvantage so <br> I suggest you to enable FakeLag only when: b-hopping, peaking and long distance fights.
## Is this cheating?
> #### As I said in the question up there, I personally don't consider it cheating but Krunker admins may think in a different way.
## How much "power" should I use?
> #### It depends from user to user, I suggest to keep the ping under 150/200.  <br> You'll see 3 red bars in the top left if you exceed the power, eventually, you'll get kicked out so try to keep the bars yellow color.
## Why when I shoot hits don't go through?
> #### Told you, you are using too much power.
## Is it detectable?
> #### It shouldn't be detected since the server just doesn't recieve some packets instantly, but this could happen on normal gameplay. If Krunker patch the script I'll try to update it.
## Can I hide it?
> #### Fo sho, just press T and the menu will \*puff\* disappear. <br> That's also going to enable a streamer condition which will hide menu and every output of the script.
## I have a problem/question about this script
> #### If you have any problem/question just open an issue by <a href="https://github.com/AnonHexo/KrunkerWS/issues/new">clicking here</a>.
