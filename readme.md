# KrunkerWS Script
## *Lag is always annoying but what if you could manage it huh? 🧐*
---
####  KrunkerWS lets you activate FakeLag and adjust its power to make you just teleport around the map whenever you want.
## How does it work?
> #### By delaying the packets you send to the server. 
## How much "power" should I use?
> #### It depends from user to user, I suggest to keep the ping under 150/200.  <br> You'll see 3 red bars in the top left if you exceed the power, eventually, you'll get kicked out so try to keep the bars yellow color.
## Why when I shoot hits don't go through?
> #### Told you, you are using too much power.
## Is it detectable?
> #### It shouldn't be detected since the server just doesn't recieve some packets instantly, but this could happen on normal gameplay. If Krunker patch the script I'll try to update it.
## Can I hide it?
> #### Fo sho, just press T and the menu will \*puff\* disappear. <br> You can also activate a streamer mode by pasting this code in the console once you hopped in a game: <br> ```window.streamer = true``` and to toggle it off: ```window.streamer = false``` <br> I'll implement an in-game keybind if the future don't worry.
